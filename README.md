# dream

---

dream is a data processing framework written in rust.

It is at a very early stage of development and should not be used to handle real world use-cases.


## TODO

1. Add more sources.
2. Add more sinks.
3. Add more transformations.
4. Add tests.
5. Add more TODOs.

(Note: This is very much a personal research project for me at the moment, as I experiment with the ins and outs of rust as well as data processing in general. But I do intend to turn it into a fully fledged product in the future.)
